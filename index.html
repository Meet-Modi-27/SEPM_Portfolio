        <h2>📌 Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Managing shared items in group environments like hostels, student apartments, or clubs often leads to confusion. People lose track of what is available, what’s missing, and who owns what. This results in miscommunication, duplication, or under-utilization of shared resources.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
        <p>To design and develop an Android app that simplifies personal and shared inventory management. It allows users to maintain their own list of items while providing an easy way to share and view others' inventories using a secure code.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>💡 Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>The app enables users to add, update, and delete items in their inventory, share it securely via a generated code, and view shared inventories. With Firebase integration and QR scanning, the app becomes a one-stop solution for collaborative inventory tracking.</p>
