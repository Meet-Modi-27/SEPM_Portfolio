    <h1>Shared Inventory</h1>
    <p>A Smart Way to Manage and Share Items</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In many group scenarios such as hostels, clubs, or shared apartments, people often struggle to manage shared items. Keeping track of what items are available, where they are, and who owns them becomes confusing and unorganized.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To create an Android application that allows users to manage their own inventory and also view inventories shared by others. The app helps reduce confusion, saves time, and ensures better coordination between users.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>The Shared Inventory app provides a simple way for users to add, update, and delete items from their personal inventory. They can also generate a code and share it with others, allowing them to view the shared items. This builds a centralized and transparent system for tracking shared resources.</p>
